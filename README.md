# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To install node module, you can run:
### `yarn `

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Screencast for Sample of the front-end

# Screenshots for Sample of the front-end
1. https://github.com/popinc/local-frontend/blob/dev/screenshots/Screenshot_1.png

You can see this screen if you run the app.
On this screen, you can see the states (mint price, total mint count or total supply) of StampNFT, PassportNFT,and Local Token.

2. https://github.com/popinc/local-frontend/blob/dev/screenshots/Screenshot_2.png

When you try to connect your metamask, you can see the short address on screen.
Once you connected your metamask, you can see the count of your StampNFT, PassportNFT, and Local Token balance.

3. https://github.com/popinc/local-frontend/blob/dev/screenshots/Screenshot_3.png

When you try to mint the StampNFT, you can see the progress bar.
Once mint transaction is completed, you can see to increase the total minted count and your NFT count.

4. https://github.com/popinc/local-frontend/blob/dev/screenshots/Screenshot_4.png

When you try to mint the PassportNFT, you can see the progress bar.
Once mint transaction is completed, you can see to increase the total minted count and your NFT count.

5. https://github.com/popinc/local-frontend/blob/dev/screenshots/Screenshot_5.png

When you input the mint amount (0~ maxTxAmount(250)) and try to mint the Local Token, you can see the progress bar.
Once mint transaction is completed, you can see to increase the total Supply and your local balance.

You can see the result for above operations on this screen.
